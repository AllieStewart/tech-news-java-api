## What I Have Learned
Using IntelliJ IDEA as my Java IDE, I've learned quite a bit </br>
about how Java works, utilizing object-oriented programming. </br>
Building models and repositories, that coordinate with the main </br>
entry point and connects to MySQL felt natural, like building </br>
a C# project. </br>
Imports can be detected and added accordingly, which is </br>
remarkably intuitive. Dependencies were added way ahead of time </br>
through Spring Initalizr, which really gave insight into the </br>
scope of what this project will do. </br>
